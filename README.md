<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

Popper is a (0% commission) membership based platform that allows creators to build exclusive communities and developers to BUIDL with the best brains in the Web3.0 space.

Users can subscribe to an exclusive gold/diamond level created by creators, and become a member of the elite community. They may also show their support for their favourite creative by clicking the "cheer" button connected to each of the creator's posts, which goes straight to the creator.

Popper utilises the lightening fast, minimual gas fees network of polygon to connect with its smart contracts and leverages IPFS technology (primarily the web3.storage service) to hold all of the post's images as well as their metadata and the metadata of each level decentrally and access it through the IPFS gateway.

The Popper website is currently hosted on Fleek.

Contracts are deployed at: [0x143880c71409a009c9448F3968C277C58495474f](https://mumbai.polygonscan.com/address/0x143880c71409a009c9448F3968C277C58495474f#code)
